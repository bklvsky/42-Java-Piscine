# Chapter I

# Exercise 00 : File Signatures

```
Exercise 00
```
```
File Signatures
Turn-in directory : ex 00 /
Files to turn in : *.java, signatures.txt
Allowed functions : All
Recommended types : Java Collections API (List<T>, Map<K, V> , etc.) InputStream,
OutputStream, FileInputStream, FileOutputStream
```
Input/output classes in Java are represented by a broad hierarchy. The key classes
describing byte input/output behavior are abstract classes InputStream and OutputStream.
They do not implement specific mechanisms for byte flows processing, rather delegate
them to their subclasses, such as FileInputStream/FileOutputStream.

To understand the use of this functionality, you should implement an application for
analyzing signatures of arbitrary files. This signature allows to define file content type
and consists of a set of "magic numbers." These numbers are usually located in the
beginning of the file. For example, a signature for PNG file type is represented by first
eight bytes of a file that are equal for all PNG images:

### 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A

You need to implement an application that accepts the signatures.txt as an input (you
should describe it on your own; the file name is explicitly stated in the program code). It
contains a list of file types and their respective signatures in the HEX format. Example
(specified format of this file must be adhered to):

### PNG, 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A

### GIF, 47 49 46 38 37 61

During execution, your program shall accept full paths to files on hard disk and keep
the type which file signature corresponds to. The result of program execution should


be written to result.txt file. If a signature cannot be defined, the execution result is
UNDEFINED (no information should be written into the file).

Example of program operation:

```
$java Program
-> C:/Users/Admin/images.png
PROCESSED
-> C/Users/Admin/Games/WoW.iso
PROCESSED
-> 42
```
Contents of result.txt file (there is no need to load this file as a result):
PNG
GIF

Notes:

- We can accurately determine the content type by analyzing the file signature, since
    the file extension contained in the name (e. g. image.jpg) can be changed by simply
    renaming the file.
- The signatures file shall contain at least 10 different formats for analysis.


# Chapter II

# Exercise 01 : Words

```
Exercise 01
```
```
Words
Turn-in directory : ex 01 /
Files to turn in : *.java
Allowed functions : All
Recommended types : Java Collections API, Java IO
```
In addition to classes designed to handle byte flows, Java has classes to simplify handling
of character flows (char). These include abstract classes Reader/Writer, as well as their
implementations (FileReader/FileWriter, etc.).
Of special interest are BufferedReader/BufferedWriter classes which accelerate flow handling
via buffering mechanisms.

Now you need to implement an application that will determine the level of similarity
between texts. The simplest and most obvious method to do this is to analyze the
frequency of occurrence of the same words.

Let’s assume that we have two following texts:

- aaa bba bba a ссс
- bba a a a bb xxx

Let’s create a dictionary that contains all words in these texts:

a, aaa, bb, bba, ccc, xxx

Now let’s create two vectors with length equal to that of the dictionary. In i-th position of
each vector, we shall reflect the frequency of occurrence of the i-th word in our dictionary
in the former and latter texts:

A = (1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0)


### B = (3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1)

Thus, each of these vectors characterizes the text in terms of frequency of occurrence
of words from our dictionary. Let’s determine the similarity between vectors using the
following formula:

Thus, similarity value for these vectors is:

```
Numerator A. B = (1 * 3 + 1 * 0 + 0 * 1 + 2 * 1 + 1 * 0 + 0 * 1) = 5
Denominator ||A|| * || B|| = sqrt(1 * 1 + 1 * 1 + 0 * 0 + 2 * 2 + 1 * 1 + 0 * 0) * sqrt(3 * 3 + 0 * 0 + 1 * 1 + 1
* 1 + 0 * 0 + 1 * 1) = sqrt(7) * sqrt(12) = 2.64 * 3.46 = 9.
similarity = 5 / 9.1 = 0.
```
Your goal is to implement an application that accepts two files as an input (both files are
passed as command-line arguments) and displays their similarity comparison outcome
(cosine measure).
The program shall also create dictionary.txt file containing a dictionary based on these
files.
Example of program operation:

```
$ java Program inputA.txt inputB.txt
Similarity = 0.
```
Notes:

1. Maximum size of these files is 10 MB.
2. Files may contain non-letter characters.


# Chapter III

# Exercise 02 : File Manager

```
Exercise 02
```
```
File Manager
Turn-in directory : ex 02 /
Files to turn in : *.java
Allowed functions : All
Recommended types : Java Collections API, Java IO, Files, Paths, etc.
```
Let’s implement a utility handling the files. The application shall display information
about the files, folder content and size, and provide moving/renaming functionality. In
essence, the application emulates a command line of Unix-like systems.

The program shall accept as an argument the absolute path to the folder where we start
to work, and support the following commands:

mv WHAT WHERE - enables to transfer or rename a file if WHERE contains a file name
without a path.

ls - displays the current folder contents (file and subfolder names and sizes in KB)

cd FOLDER_NAME - changes the current directory

Let’s assume there is MAIN folder on disk C:/ (or in the root directory, depending on
OS) with the following hierarchy:

- MAIN

```
◦ folder
∗ image.jpg
∗ animation.gif
```
```
◦ folder
```

```
∗ text.txt
∗ Program.java
```
Example of the program operation for MAIN directory:

```
$ java Program --current-folder=C:/MAIN
C:/MAIN
-> ls
folder1 60 KB
folder2 90 KB
-> cd folder
C:/MAIN/folder
-> ls
image.jpg 10 KB
animation.gif 50 KB
-> mv image.jpg image2.jpg
-> ls
image2.jpg 10 KB
animation.gif 50 KB
-> mv animation.gif ../folder
-> ls
image2.jpg 10 KB
-> cd ../ folder
C:/MAIN/folder
-> ls
text. txt 10 KB
Program.java 80 KB
animation.gif 50 KB
-> exit
```
Note:
You should test the program functionality using your own set of files/folders.
